William
 
Brown’s
 
account
 
of
 
his

and

during
 
the

Brown
 
found
 
himself
 
in
 
a
 
very
 
unfamiliar
 
world.
 
Because

had
 
spent
 
his

in
 
various
 
districts
 
to
 
the
 
east
 
of

A

chiefs
 
bearing
 
the
 
hereditary
 
name
 
Legiac
 
led
 
the
 
Native
 
opposition
 
to
 
the
 
HBC.
 
When
 
Brown
 
arrived
 
on
 
the
 
scene,
 
these
 
people
 
were
 
in
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
strengthening
 
their
 
ties
 
with
 
the
 
Gitxsan
 
and"
Ray Chapter 12 PLACED ON A LITTLE SPOT.pdf,"their
 
ties
 
with
 
the
 
Gitxsan
 
and

The
 
Tsimshian
 
already
 
held
 
regular
 
trading
 
fairs
 
at
 
the
 
forks
 
of
 
the
 
Skeena
 
and

rivers,
 
and
 
some
 
Gitxsan
 
and
 
Wet’suwet’en
 
undertook
 
frequent
 
expeditions
 
to
 
the
 
coast.
 
Brown
 
learned
 
that
 
he
 
would
 
have
 
great
 
difficulty
 
breaking
 
into
 
this
 
exchange
 
network
 
because
 
the
 
Tsimshian,

had
 
access
 
to

able
 
to
 
provide
 
goods
 
at
 
much
 
cheaper
 
rates
 
than
 
he
 
could.
 
To
 
address
 
this
 
problem,
 
Brown
 
resorted
 
to
 
an
 
old
 
Nor’
 
Wester
 
strategy.
 
He
 
instructed
 
the
 
company
 
to
 
import
 
moose
 
hides
 
from
 
districts
 
lying
 
to
 
the
 
east
 
of
 
the
 
Rocky
 
Mountains.
 
The
 
Babine,
 
Gitxsan,

guests
 
at

The
 
trade
 
in
 
moose
 
skins
 
remained
 
a
 
feature
 
of
 
the
 
company’s
 
business
 
in
 
Skeena
 
country
 
until
 
the
 
turn
 
of
 
this
 
century,
 
when
 
provincial

legislation

banned

hides.
 
The
 
Babine
 
tossed
 
other
 
obstacles
 
in
 
Brown’s
 
way.
 
Like
 
most"

in
 
Brown’s
 
way.
 
Like
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
nations
 
living
 
on
 
the
 
Pacific
 
slope,
 
the
 
Babine
 
were
 
experienced
 
fish
 
sellers.
 
They
 
knew
 
Brown
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
depend
 
on
 
them
 
for
 
fresh
 
and
 
dried
 
salmon
 
because
 
game
 
was
 
not
 
abundant
 
in
 
their
 
country—or
 
in
 
most
 
areas
 
of
 
New
 
Caledonia,
 
for
 
that
 
matter.
 
Soon
 
after
 
his
 
arrival,
 
the
 
Babine
 
informed
 
him
 
that
 
they
 
would

for

that
 
he
 
required.
 
Brown
 
had
 
no
 
choice
 
but
 
to
 
pay
 
their
 
high
 
prices.
 
In

of
 
the

at

the
 
trade
 
in
 
beavers

the
 
upper
 
Skeena
 
country.
 
Brown
 
quickly
 
discovered
 
that
 
each
 
chief
 
permitted
 
an
 
annual
 
harvest
 
of
 
only
 
about
 
twenty-five
 
beavers
 
from
 
his
 
house
 
territory.
 
These
 
leaders,
 
whom
 
Brown
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
“men
 
of
 
property,”
 
or
 
“nobles,”
 
limited
 
the
 
harvest
 
partly
 
by
 
denying
 
most
 
of
 
their
 
followers
 
the
 
right
 
to"

their
 
followers
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
hunt
 
beavers.
 
As
 
well,
 
they
 
jealously
 
guarded
 
their
 
domain
 
against
 
the
 
incursions
 
of
 
outsiders.
 
When
 
Governor
 
Simpson
 
visited
 
the
 
district,
 
he
 
reported
 
that
 
the
 
chiefs
 
regarded
 
any
 
trespass
 
on
 
their
 
houses’
 
lands
 
as
 
being
 
tantamount
 
to
 
a
 
declaration
 
of
 
war.
 
In
 
1826
 
Brown
 
tried
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
Babine
 
to
 
agree
 
to

called

had

politely
 
to

rejected

also
 
refused
 
to

commercial
 
trapping
 
activities
 
any
 
priority,
 
in

of

repeated

spent
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
long
 
winter
 
months
 
doing
 
what
 
they
 
liked
 
best—
 
feasting,
 
gambling,
 
and
 
socializing.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
chiefs,
 
who
 
handled
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
trade
 
of
 
their
 
followers,
 
refused
 
to

with
 
other

the

trade

the

to
 
try

tactic.

so
 
the
 
company
 
could
 
become
 
the
 
Tsimshian’s
 
primary
 
supplier.
 
This
 
was
 
part
 
of
 
an
 
overall
 
strategy
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
strong
 
presence
 
on
 
the
 
coast,
 
which
 
began
 
in
 
1827
 
with
 
the

of

Langley
 
on
 
the
 
lower

to

most
 
of
 
the
 
key
 
mainland
 
coastal
 
groups.
 
To
 
enhance
 
its
 
position
 
even
 
further,
 
the
 
company
 
eliminated
 
Russian
 
competition
 
from
 
the
 
north
 
by
 
negotiating
 
an
 
arrangement
 
with
 
the
 
Russian
 
American
 
Fur
 
Company
 
in
 
1839.

reports
 
describing
 
this

as

to
 
send
 
Hearne
 
on
 
a
 
gruelling
 
thousand-mile
 
trek
 
on
 
foot
 
to
 
investigate.
 
From
 
two
 
previous
 
attempts,
 
Hearne
 
had
 
learned
 
three
 
hard
 
lessons.

at
 
the
 
pace
 
they
 
set
 
for
 
themselves.
 
With
 
these
 
lessons
 
in
 
mind,

at

some
 
forty-five
 
years
 
earlier,
 
he
 
had
 
become
 
a
 
prominent
 
trading
 
captain
 
there.
 
Matonabbee
 
taught
 
Hearne
 
the
 
third,
 
and
 
probably
 
most
 
important,
 
key
 
to
 
success:
 
bring
 
Native
 
women.
 
Hearne
 
said
 
that
 
Matonabbee
 
“attributed
 
all
 
our
 
misfortunes
 
to
 
the
 
misconduct
 
of
 
my
 
guides,
 
and

to
 
Hearne,
 
Matonabbee
 
explained
 
this
 
by
 
pointing
 
out
 
that
 
“[w]hen

led
 
to

To

Selkirk
 
decided
 
to
 
obtain

consent
 
before

occupied
 
a
 
portion
 
of
 
their
 
lands.
 
In
 
the
 
summer
 
of
 
1817,
 
a
 
treaty
 
was
 
signed,
 
under
 
which
 
the

and
 
at

the
 
corridor
 
extended
 
to
 
six
 
miles.
 
In

agreed
 
to

payment

they

are

for

During

government
 
spokesmen
 
repeatedly
 
promised
 
that

All

contain
 
a
 
similar
 
clause.
 
Later,
 
Morris
 
also
 
promised
 
during

days.

it
 
remained
 
in

eagerly

the
 
process.
 
As

as

process.
 
As
 
soon
 
as
 
he
 
had
 
taken
 
up
 
residence
 
in
 
his
 
new
 
homeland,
 
Joseph
 
Brant
 
began
 
awarding
 
grants
 
of
 
land
 
to
 
settlers.
 
By
 
1797
 
the
 
Six
 
Nations
 
had

away,
 
sold,
 
or
 
leased

350,000
 
acres
 
of
 
the
 
nearly
 
675,000
 
they
 
had
 
originally
 
received.
 
The
 
chief
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
backed
 
him
 
did
 
so
 
for
 
several
 
reasons.
 
First,

grants
 
to
 
Brant’s
 
friends
 
and
 
those
 
of
 
other

Second,
 
Brant
 
concluded
 
that
 
the
 
tract
 
his
 
followers
 
had
 
received
 
was
 
much
 
larger
 
than
 
they
 
could
 
farm
 
or
 
develop
 
in
 
other
 
ways,
 
and
 
that
 
settlers
 
eventually
 
would
 
surround
 
the
 
reserve,
 
cutting
 
off
 
the
 
Six
 
Nations
 
from
 
their
 
hunting
 
lands.
 
However,
 
if
 
they
 
sold
 
and
 
leased
 
lands
 
to
 
settlers,
 
they"
Ray C H A P T E R 10   FIGHTING THE LOYALISTS FOR LAND.pdf,"and
 
leased
 
lands
 
to
 
settlers,
 
they
 
could
 
generate
 
an
 
annuity.
 
And
 
finally,
 
Brant
 
argued
 
that
 
settlers
 
could
 
teach
 
the
 
Six
 
Nations
 
new
 
farming
 
methods
 
and
 
build
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
facilities,
 
such
 
as
 
grist
 
and
 
sawmills,
 
that
 
his
 
people
 
would
 
need.
 
Not
 
surprisingly,
 
Brant’s
 
land
 
deals
 
were
 
controversial.

of

heartland
 
of
 
the

for

For
 
this
 
reason,
 
they
 
considered
 
the
 
establishment
 
of
 
a
 
western
 
“Indian

to
 
be
 
a

In
 
the

of
 
Fort

Native
 
groups
 
endorsed
 
the

a

between
 
the

and
 
the
 
colonies
 
appeared

was
 
the

step

this

the

redrew
 
the

the

themselves

now
 
the

The
 
Iroquois
 
leaders
 
had
 
to
 
answer
 
two
 
crucial
 
questions,
 
Which
 
side
 
was
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
win,
 
and
 
Which
 
one
 
would
 
protect

Unable
 
to
 
agree
 
on
 
the
 
answers,
 
in
 
1777
 
they
 
“covered

council

Initially,
 
the
 
Mississauga
 
resisted
 
the
 
idea
 
of
 
providing
 
land
 
for
 
their
 
old
 
foes.
 
However,
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
of
 
their
 
leaders,
 
Pokquan,
 
decided
 
that
 
the
 
Iroquois
 
were
 
preferable
 
to
 
European
 
settlers
 
and
 
that
 
Brant’s
 
knowledge
 
of
 
the
 
British
 
could
 
be
 
useful
 
to
 
his
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
future.

do

tried
 
to
 
put
 
a
 
positive
 
gloss
 
on

declaring

Turning
 
to

the
 
chief
 
continued,

from

At
 
a
 
much
 
earlier
 
date,
 
the
 
Spanish
 
had
 
introduced
 
the
 
animals
 
to
 
the
 
southern
 
plains.
 
From
 
there
 
they
 
spread
 
northward
 
through
 
Native
 
trading
 
networks
 
and
 
horse-raiding
 
activities.

Shortly
 
thereafter,
 
Plains

In
 
these

a

Taking

was
 
a
 
great
 
coup
 
that
 
earned
 
the

the
